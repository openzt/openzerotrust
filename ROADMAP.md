Roadmap
---

The roadmap represents the directions of enhancements we have planned for the project. The specific features and bug fixes can be tracked in issues and milestones.
- Multi-cluster security monitoring and management to enable and ease deployment and management of security policies across multiple clusters, including hybrid and multi-cloud environments.
- Enhance support for vulnerability and compliance check workflow management for identifying, classifying and remediating CVEs and compliance checks.
- Extending monitoring and enforcement of ‘zero-trust’ security templates across multiple technologies in the cloud-native stack (orchestration, OS/VM, storage, workloads, IAM, registries etc).
- Additional Kubernetes resource real-time auditing (and yaml file scans) to verify configuration compliance rules
- Additional support for public cloud (AWS, Microsoft, Google, IBM etc) configuration auditing for compliance, alerting, and reporting.
- Integration and support for Kubewarden, Longhorn, K3s and other CNCF projects
